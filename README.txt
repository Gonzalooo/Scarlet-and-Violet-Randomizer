*** THIS RANDOMIZER WORKS ONLY WITH VERSION 3.0.1/3.0.0***
PREFACE: Make sure you have at least Python 3.10 installed on your computer, anything lower will not work!
NOTE: Be sure you are dumping the files of the 3.0.0 or 3.0.1 version of the game.
PS: If after installing, and running the randomize batch script you see the Microsoft store open instead, in your windows search bar type "Manage App Execution Aliases" and turn off the ones that have "python.exe" and "python3.exe" under them (They are named App Installer)

ALTERNATE WAY HOW TO USE: (ONLY READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO USE AUTO-PATCHER)

- If not done, install Python 3.10 from either the Microsoft Store, or the official python website

Step 1: Open the config.json in any text editor (even notepad works) and configure the file how you want it. To enable an option, type yes between quotes. If you want to disable , then type no instead.
Step 2: Save your edits to the config.json, and double click the randomize.bat file. A window will appear with some logs, and eventually a Press Enter to continue will appear, then you can close that window.
Step 3: A new folder called "output" will be created. Go inside of it, and you will see a romfs folder as well as a randomizer.zip file. The randomizer.zip is the compressed, ready-to-use modpack to be imported in Trinity Mod Loader.
		- Romfs Folder is there for legacy reasons. Will be useful in the future.
Step 4:(patch-trpfd: "no") Open Trinity Loader, click "Add Mod (.zip)" and select the randomizer.zip inside the output folder, make sure it is ticked in the window, and then click Apply mod.
        - Copy the resulting romfs folder to your mods folder on your switch or emulator, and launch the game
Step 4:(patch-trpfd: "yes") Move the romfs that is located in "randomizer-patched" or "randomizer-patched-shiny" to your mod folder
       If you wish to share the patched randomizer with a friend to play on the same seed send them the .zip file that is located in that folder
       The zip file will contain the romfs folder so all they have to do is extract it and move their romfs to their mod folder
Step 5: Enjoy :)

--- General Info ----

This is a rework of my previous randomizer that I made via code injection. This randomizer went through multiple reworks, at first having individual randomizers, now to having an easy-to-use configuration file
and program that does all the randomization and packaging for you. It currently randomizes Wild Encounters, Trainers, Static encounters, Personal Data (Abilities, and Movesets), Starters (and all gifted pokemons by extension),
and also provides a few extra options to customize your randomisation.
If you have "patch_trpfd" as no on the config.json then:
    It packages the resulting randomization to a zip file in the output folder, so all you need to do is import it in Trinity Loader and apply the mod.
However, if you have it as "yes" then we will auto-patch the randomzer for you so you don't have to use trinity loader

If you use this program for content, credits in the description is not required, but always appreciated ! If there are any problems with the program whatsoever, yall know where to find me :)
